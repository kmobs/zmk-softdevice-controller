# ZMK SoftDevice Controller + Connection Subrating

A ZMK Zephyr module that replaces Zephyr's built-in BLE link layer (`BT_LL_SW_SPLIT`) with Nordic's [SoftDevice Controller](https://docs.nordicsemi.com/bundle/ncs-latest/page/nrfxlib/softdevice_controller/README.html), primarily to enable Bluetooth LE Connection Subrating for significant split keyboard power savings. A split central could see a 4x improvement in battery life with subrating enabled.

Note that subrating benefits only apply to the connection between split keyboard parts, mostly the central. Host devices rarely support subrating; even when they do, the power savings by subrating that link are negligible.

> [!WARNING]
> This is very very experimental and the subrating bits are largely LLM coded, use at your own risk.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> nRF52840 is the only supported SoC for the time being. The module only works with current ZMK main branch based on Zephyr 4.1.

## Usage

Add this module to your `config/west.yml`:

```yaml
manifest:
  remotes:
    - name: zmkfirmware
      url-base: https://github.com/zmkfirmware
    - name: carrefinho
      url-base: https://github.com/carrefinho
  projects:
    - name: zmk
      remote: zmkfirmware
      revision: main
      import: app/west.yml
    - name: zmk-feature-softdevice-subrating
      remote: carrefinho
      repo-path: zmk-softdevice-controller
      revision: main
      import: config/west.yml
  self:
    path: config
```

Then enable the SoftDevice controller and subrating using the snippet in your `build.yaml`:

```yaml
---
include:
  - board: xiao_ble
    shield: your_shield
    snippet: softdevice-controller
```

Build and flash all parts of your split keyboard with the snippet enabled. The split connection will automatically adjust subrating parameters based on typing activity. 

Existing BLE bonds (both host devices and split peripherals) should continue to work without re-pairing. However, pairing new devices may have issues while on SoftDevice Controller; if you encounter problems, try pairing with the Zephyr controller first (without the snippet) then switch to SDC.
